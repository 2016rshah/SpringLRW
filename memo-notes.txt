notes
	DISTRICT OF GUAM: Mongmong, Guam (9th Cir.)

	prefer entrapment as matter of law (JNOV?) 
	in the alternative, seek a new trial


	can't be cumulative
		not sufficient to buttress points made at trial
	can't be merely impeaching
		not sufficient to say agent lopez lied, etc.

theory of case
	coercion
		motive for coercion
			lopez was just doing this for promotion
				reason it isn't central: lopez was being a good agent, setting up a good sting


		imagery words
			coercion
			twist arm
			force
			manipulate
			control
				bad because higher bar than pressured
			pressured
			held hostage
			sabotage



	help mom
		momma's boy makes him sympathetic

		predisposition: going to school already to help his mom


	agent lopez coerced hark's/turned his life into hell/targeted him for coercion
		
		coerced
			momma's boy
				already trying to help out mom
					he was going to school

			repeatedly

	"Hark had everything under control until agent lopez sabotaged his life"
		Agent Lopez was the reason for Hark's financial troubles, which was not able to be presented at the original trial
		not predisposed (which was dispositive for lack of entrapment) because Hark was only motivated by making money because Agent Lopez introduced artificial financial obstacles into Hark's life
			motivated by ~money~ -> motivated by *agent lopez*

	* "Hark had everything under control until agent lopez sabotaged his life"
