"[T]o prevail on a Rule 33 motion for a new trial, the movant must satisfy a five-part test: (1) the evidence must be newly discovered; (2) the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant's part; (3) the evidence must be material to the issues at trial; (4) the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and (5) the evidence must indicate that a new trial would probably result in acquittal." United States v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, 548 (9th Cir. 1991). The five part test does not include any provisions for considering the cost of a new trial. United States v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, 548 (9th Cir. 1991).

Rule 33 motions are reviewed on an abuse of discretion standard. United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1259 (9th Cir. 2009). A lower court must make a decision by identifying and applying the correct legal rule for the relief sought. United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1259 (9th Cir. 2009). That decision will be an abuse of discretion if it is "illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record". United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1259 (9th Cir. 2009). 

Evidence is considered "newly discovered" if it is "discovered after the trial." Pitts v. United States, 263 F.2d 808, 810 (9th Cir. 1959). This court will reject as not newly discovered any new testimony from known witnesses who had the opportunity to present it during the trial. See United States v. Reyes-Alvarado, 963 F.2d 1184 (9th Cir. 1992), as amended (June 15, 1992) (rejecting post-trial codefendant testimony because holding otherwise would encourage perjury); United States v. DePalma, 461 F.2d 240 (9th Cir. 1972) (rejecting testimony by a defense witness who was known to be out of the country because no request for a continuance was made at the time of trial).

The defendant is considered "diligent" if they "take advantage of reasonably available means to obtain known or suspected evidence." United States v. Brugnara, 856 F.3d 1198, 1206 (9th Cir. 2017). For example, defendants must notify the judge of difficulty in locating known witnesses. United States v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, 548-49 (9th Cir. 1991). They must request known documents from the organization that maintains those records. United States v. George, 420 F.3d 991, 1000â€“01 (9th Cir. 2005). And they must follow the appropriate procedure for appointing an expert witness at the court's recommendation for a known issue. United States v. Brugnara, 856 F.3d 1198, 1206 (9th Cir. 2017). 

To be considered "material" to an issue at trial, evidence must "refute an essential element of the government's case." United States v. Davis, 960 F.2d 820, 825 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 873 (1992). To do so, the evidence must establish more than a merely collateral point. See United States v. George, 420 F.3d 991, 1001 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding evidence about who actually prepared a fraudulent tax return is collateral to determining what advice was given about the declarations on the tax return). Furthermore, evidence that just attempts to cast doubt upon facts overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented at trial will be held to be immaterial. United States v. Norman, 402 F.2d 73, 78 (9th Cir. 1968) (determining a phone listing held in someone else's name does not refute other substantial evidence that the defendant lived at the relevant address). Evidence can be "entirely too remote" to be material if it relates to a party who "was not a witness at the trial" and "had no connection with the prosecution." Henry v. United States, 12 F.2d 670, 671 (9th Cir. 1926).

Prong four -- that evidence must be more than "merely cumulative" and more than "merely impeaching" -- follows as a corollary of prong three -- that evidence must be material. United States v. Walgren, 885 F.2d 1417, 1428 (9th Cir. 1989). If the evidence's sole purpose is to corroborate testimony taken at trial, it will be rejected as "cumulative". Morgan v. United States, 301 F.2d 272, 275 (9th Cir. 1962). Similarly, if the evidence's sole purpose is to impeach testimony taken at trial, it will also be rejected. United States v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, 549 (9th Cir. 1991). But that is not to say corroborating or impeaching evidence cannot be material. For example, "[i]n some situations, ... if the witness' testimony were uncorroborated and provided the only evidence of an essential element of the government's case, the impeachment evidence would be 'material,'" and therefore more than *merely* impeaching. United States v. Davis, 960 F.2d 820, 825 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 873 (1992). Therefore, the key analysis for this prong remains whether or not the evidence refutes an essential element of the government's case. United States v. Davis, 960 F.2d 820, 825 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 873 (1992). 

Finally, the evidence must probably result in acquittal. United States v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, 548 (9th Cir. 1991). To be so considered, the evidence must establish an element of the legal argument being raised. United States v. Joelson, 7 F.3d 174 (9th Cir. 1993) (determining an affidavit by a coconspirator's wife does not demonstrate the defendant satisfied the first and third elements of the duress defense). When conflicting evidence is newly presented, the court must determine whether there would still be "sufficient evidence to support" the conviction "even without" the challenged evidence. United States v. Berry, 624 F.3d 1031, 1043 (9th Cir. 2010). A lack of specificity in the testimony will negatively impact the probability of acquittal. United States v. Claiborne, 870 F.2d 1463 (9th Cir. 1989) (determining the testimony's lack of specificity about the date and contents of a secretary's delivery makes it "highly improbable that [the] testimony at trial would have changed anything"). 

---

If impeachment evidence supports a factual finding of perjury by a government witness, that may be grounds for a new trial. United States v. Krasny, 607 F.2d 840, 845 (9th Cir. 1979). There is no per se rule that a finding of perjury will sustain a new trial, but it may if the perjury wholly discredits a key government witness's credibility. Compare United States v. Krasny, 607 F.2d 840 (9th Cir. 1979) (remanding the case to give a district judge the "first opportunity" to "appraise the impact of the newly-discovered evidence not only upon the factual elements of the government's case but also upon the credibility of the government's witness"), with Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1 (1956), United States v. Young, 17 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 1994), United States v. Chisum, 436 F.2d 645 (9th Cir. 1971), Williams v. United States, 500 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1974) (all granting a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence of perjury).
