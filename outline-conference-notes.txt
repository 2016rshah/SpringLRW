entrapment 
	standard of review
		"undisputed evidence making it patently clear"

	inducement
		pull the list from williams (?)

		*any* gov conduct creating substantial risk including _______ list of stuff
			hammer home the "any" part of the phrase

	there are some cases where predisposition is a stronger weight than inducement. so there is a line in "if predisposed then entrapment is unavailible regardless of inducement", which we need to watch out for

	predisposition
		previous drug conviction for cocaine v heroin v marijuana
			marijuana is not a huge gateway to heroin

		length of time (case citation)
			18 to 24 age

		reluctance
			flesh this out a LOT
			opponents will say weak reluctance is not enough
			cautious != reluctant, so we need to establish stronger reluctance not caution

	nature of inducement in predisposition versus inducement in first prong difference?
		first prong is whether there is any inducement yes or no
		but second prong is nature/degree of the inducement
			emphasize misrepresentations, ...

	don't focus on the argument about profit not being profit margin
		but maybe family safety being threatened

	discuss all three affidavits split up instead of factor by factor
		makes it seem all different

		they provide some new information about lopez's credibility 
			frequency of contact
			amount of mentions of heroin

			first affidavit
				trying to go out of his way
				conversation she heard (play up the family angle) - intentional and explicit about exploiting mother's sickness
			second affidavit
				saw lopez looking through window
				talks about family a lot
				guam police are negligent

				napkin

				ending the conversation goes to reluctance

	diligence
		hide behind the trial court
		talk about in the alternate
		can't interview every potential witness (every student, especially everybody at the coffee shop)

	history of rule 33

	new trial is less formalistic, requires more creative argumentation. discuss rather than

	use unpublished cases as persuasive

	find case that talks about how there was no way of knowing there was relevant information unknown to defendant at the time of the trial

	materiality
		ninth circuit not super clear 
		self referential definition defined as likelihood to result in acquittal
		free to collapse those factors and discuss them together

	1926 might be too early

	have a section that is purely policy based
		we should take very seriously a government agent going out of their way to target someone, especially when they targetted him for no reason.
		give him everything
			contact, drugs, "changed material circumstances", etc.
			paragraph or two
