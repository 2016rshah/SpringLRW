Where, as here, the entrapment defense is submitted to the jury, an appellate court should not disturb the jury's finding unless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the government had disproved either of the elements of the entrapment defense. United States v. Poehlman, 217 F.3d 692, 698 (9th Cir.2000).

		"“Inducement has been defined as ‘repeated and persistent solicitation’ or ‘persuasion’ which overcomes the defendant's reluctance.

				(1) has been discovered since the trial, (2) could not have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence, (3) is material to the issue, (4) is not merely cumulative or impeaching, and (5) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted.

				motion denied
				Codefendants' testimony exculpating defendant was not newly discovered evidence which entitled defendant to new trial; there was no evidence that codefendants were forced to refrain from testifying during defendant's trial but, rather, it was probably prudent for them to decline to testify and now after they had been sentenced, it was safe for them to testify. (headnote)

				"It would encourage perjury to allow a new trial once co-defendants have determined that testifying is no longer harmful to themselves. They may say whatever they think might help their co-defendant, even to the point of pinning all the guilt on themselves, knowing they are safe from retrial. Such testimony would be untrustworthy and should not be encouraged. We find that the judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence."

		standard of review
			* United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247 (9th Cir. 2009)
				apply abuse of discretion standard for rule 33 with detailed explanation
					"We review a district court's order denying a motion for a new trial made on the ground of newly discovered evidence for abuse of discretion. United States v. Reyes–Alvarado, 963 F.2d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir.1992). We invoke that standard of review as we have hundreds of times before, but this case forces us to step back and consider precisely what “abuse of discretion” means, in the context of a trial court's factual findings, as applied to legal rules." (1259)

				abuse of discretion standard is two part test
					did trial court identify correct legal rule
					was trial court clearly erroneous when making a decision that was any of the following three
						illogical
						implausible
						without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record

					"Accordingly, we hold that when we review for abuse of discretion a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial, we first look to whether the trial court identified and applied the correct legal rule to the relief requested. Second, we look to whether the trial court's resolution of the motion resulted from a factual finding that was illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record. In other words, our abuse of discretion test means that we do not automatically affirm a district court's factual finding if we decide it is “permissible,” and we do not automatically reverse a district court's factual finding if we decide a “mistake has been committed.” Rather, in either case, we will affirm a district court's factual finding unless that finding is illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record." (1263, footnotes omitted)

				harrington test is essentially factual
					"because the Harrington test is essentially factual, requiring considerations that are “founded on the application of the fact-finding tribunal's experience with the mainsprings of human conduct,” rather than requiring “consideration of abstract legal principles,” McConney, 728 F.2d at 1202, we look to whether the district court's findings of fact, and its application of those findings of fact to the Harrington factors, were illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from facts in the record." (1264)

				dissent says elements (3), (4), and (5) of harrington test are duplicative
					"Although we ordinarily state the test as comprising five requirements, we have recognized that requirements (3), (4), and (5) are duplicative. That is, newly discovered evidence is “material” when the result of the newly discovered evidence is that “a new trial would probably result in acquittal,” a condition that is not usually met when the newly discovered evidence is “cumulative [ ]or merely impeaching.” See, e.g., United States v. Krasny, 607 F.2d 840, 845 n. 3 (9th Cir.1979) (noting that the materiality and probability requirements “are really two means of measuring the same thing”); United States v. Davila, 428 F.2d 465, 466 (9th Cir.1970) (per curiam) (noting that newly discovered impeachment evidence supports a new trial if “it is likely that the jury would have reached a different result” in light of the evidence); see also Wright et al., supra, § 557, at 552."

						"To overturn the denial of a new trial in this case by the two lower courts would be tantamount to saying that any subsequently discovered inaccuracy in the testimony of an important trial witness, which might have affected his credibility in the eyes of the jury, would entitle a convicted defendant to a new trial.

				942 Impeachment of Witness > 942(2) Contradictory statements by witness
					Untruthful statements by Government witness subsequent to trial do not ordinarily constitute such newly discovered evidence as will entitle defendant to new trial. (headnote)

			United States v. Johnson, 327 U.S. 106 (1946)
				found through WestLaw Keys

				Neither the Supreme Court nor the Circuit Court of Appeals may review orders granting or denying motion for a new trial when such review is sought on the alleged ground that the trial court made erroneous findings of fact. (headnote)

				Where the appellate court might intervene when the findings of fact are wholly unsupported by the evidence, it should never do so where it does not clearly appear that the findings are not supported by any evidence. (headnote)

				"[the privilege of a motion for a new trial] might lend itself for use as a method of delaying enforcement of just sentences. Especially is this true where delay is extended by appeals lacking in merit. This case will illustrates this possibility. While a defendant should be afforded the full benefit of this type of rectifying motion, courts should be on the alert to see that the privilege of its use is not abused." (112-13)

				"But it is not the province of this Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals to review orders granting or denying motions for a new trial when such review is sought on the alleged ground that the trial court made erroneous findings of fact."  (111)
					we need to make sure that we don't frame it as the trial court made erroneous findings of fact

			Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384 (1990)
				abuse of discretion = clearly erroneous				

				“Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” (400–401)

				cited in Hinkson (1259) for abuse of discretion standard explanation 
					"The Supreme Court explained the meaning of the abuse of discretion standard in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), where the court stated, “A district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id. at 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447. In other words, the Court defined abuse of discretion review of factual findings in terms of “clearly erroneous” review, holding that “[w]hen an appellate court reviews a district court's factual findings, the abuse-of-discretion and clearly erroneous standards are indistinguishable: A court of appeals would be justified in concluding that a district court had abused its discretion in making a factual finding only if the finding were clearly erroneous.” Id. at 400–01, 110 S.Ct. 2447."
