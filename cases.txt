	United States v. Jones, 231 F.3d 508 (9th Cir. 2000)
		"Generally, whether a defendant was entrapped is a question for the jury.4 Id. at 1430 (citing Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 377, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958)). Where, as here, the entrapment defense is submitted to the jury, an appellate court should not disturb the jury's finding unless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the government had disproved either of the elements of the entrapment defense. United States v. Poehlman, 217 F.3d 692, 698 (9th Cir.2000). In this case, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find either that Appellant was not induced by government agents or that he was predisposed to commit the crimes charged.5" (516)

		"“Inducement has been defined as ‘repeated and persistent solicitation’ or ‘persuasion’ which overcomes the defendant's reluctance. Mere suggestions or the offering of an opportunity to commit a crime is not conduct amounting to inducement.” United States v. Simas, 937 F.2d 459, 462 (9th Cir.1991) (citations omitted)." (517)

			five factors for predisposition
			“Although none of these five factors controls, the most important is the defendant's reluctance to engage in criminal activity.” (1217)

			"What constitutes "newly discovered evidence" within meaning of Rule 33 of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to motions for new trial"

			This annotation focuses on the first two of the above requirements plus the question whether the new material is "evidence" for the purposes of granting a new trial.
				(1) has been discovered since the trial, (2) could not have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence, (3) is material to the issue, (4) is not merely cumulative or impeaching, and (5) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted.

			"The newly discovered evidence must be material.

				five-step test to prevail on Rule 33 motion
					"(1) the evidence must be newly discovered; 
					(2) the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant's part; 
					(3) the evidence must be material to the issues at trial; 
					(4) the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and 
					(5) the evidence must indicate that a new trial would probably result in acquittal." (601)

			United States v. Walgren, 885 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1989)
				lower standard when government misconduct than when merely new evidence is merely discovered 
					"Walgren based his motion for a new trial on three grounds: 1) the government made knowing use of perjured testimony; 2) the government failed to disclose evidence favorable to him in response to his discovery requests; and 3) even if the government did not act improperly, the newly-discovered evidence entitles him to a new trial. The defendant carries a different burden in order to establish each of these bases for a new trial." (1427)

		standard of review
			* United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247 (9th Cir. 2009)
				apply abuse of discretion standard for rule 33 with detailed explanation
					"We review a district court's order denying a motion for a new trial made on the ground of newly discovered evidence for abuse of discretion. United States v. Reyes–Alvarado, 963 F.2d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir.1992). We invoke that standard of review as we have hundreds of times before, but this case forces us to step back and consider precisely what “abuse of discretion” means, in the context of a trial court's factual findings, as applied to legal rules." (1259)

				abuse of discretion standard is two part test
					did trial court identify correct legal rule
					was trial court clearly erroneous when making a decision that was any of the following three
						illogical
						implausible
						without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record

					"Accordingly, we hold that when we review for abuse of discretion a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial, we first look to whether the trial court identified and applied the correct legal rule to the relief requested. Second, we look to whether the trial court's resolution of the motion resulted from a factual finding that was illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record. In other words, our abuse of discretion test means that we do not automatically affirm a district court's factual finding if we decide it is “permissible,” and we do not automatically reverse a district court's factual finding if we decide a “mistake has been committed.” Rather, in either case, we will affirm a district court's factual finding unless that finding is illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record." (1263, footnotes omitted)

				harrington test is essentially factual
					"because the Harrington test is essentially factual, requiring considerations that are “founded on the application of the fact-finding tribunal's experience with the mainsprings of human conduct,” rather than requiring “consideration of abstract legal principles,” McConney, 728 F.2d at 1202, we look to whether the district court's findings of fact, and its application of those findings of fact to the Harrington factors, were illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from facts in the record." (1264)

				dissent says elements (3), (4), and (5) of harrington test are duplicative
					"Although we ordinarily state the test as comprising five requirements, we have recognized that requirements (3), (4), and (5) are duplicative. That is, newly discovered evidence is “material” when the result of the newly discovered evidence is that “a new trial would probably result in acquittal,” a condition that is not usually met when the newly discovered evidence is “cumulative [ ]or merely impeaching.” See, e.g., United States v. Krasny, 607 F.2d 840, 845 n. 3 (9th Cir.1979) (noting that the materiality and probability requirements “are really two means of measuring the same thing”); United States v. Davila, 428 F.2d 465, 466 (9th Cir.1970) (per curiam) (noting that newly discovered impeachment evidence supports a new trial if “it is likely that the jury would have reached a different result” in light of the evidence); see also Wright et al., supra, § 557, at 552."

			Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384 (1990)
				abuse of discretion = clearly erroneous				

				“Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” (400–401)

				cited in Hinkson (1259) for abuse of discretion standard explanation 
					"The Supreme Court explained the meaning of the abuse of discretion standard in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), where the court stated, “A district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id. at 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447. In other words, the Court defined abuse of discretion review of factual findings in terms of “clearly erroneous” review, holding that “[w]hen an appellate court reviews a district court's factual findings, the abuse-of-discretion and clearly erroneous standards are indistinguishable: A court of appeals would be justified in concluding that a district court had abused its discretion in making a factual finding only if the finding were clearly erroneous.” Id. at 400–01, 110 S.Ct. 2447."
